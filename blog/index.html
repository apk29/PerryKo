              <p>I was in a motorcycle accident, my left leg was so severely damaged that they had to amputate my left leg at the knee joint. Luckily I had HMO insurance and they covered my ~250K bill except for $500.00 for the hosiptal copays. I had to go to two hospital, UCLA Ronald Reagan and UCLA Santa Monica. I'm glad I had HMO insurace before the accident, but I will get into more details about getting PPO insurace later.

              <p> Insurance
              </p>
              <p>If you can, get PPO insurance rather than HMO, PPO insurance allows you to use your insurance at any care provider (within network or outside). If you do go outside of network, it will be more expensive. In general, PPO insurace is more expensive to use as well. 
              </p>
              <p>In my experience, you'll want to go to a prothetist you choose not the one the insurance company offers. Like everything, there are really good providers and there are plenty of really bad providers. I've had more bad than good. When it comes to me walking and being active, having a good prosthetist is key! In the insurance world, 
                a prosthetist is a specialist that makes prosthetics. They are not doctors, you'll still need prescription from a doctor in order to get a prosthetic. 
              </p>
              <p>Prosthetist 
              </p>
              <p>
                To me this is the individual to works with you, your doctor, and the insurance company to help you make and get your prosthesis. 
              </p>
              <p>
                If the first word out the prosthetist's mouth is "I've been doing this for XX years", leave! I've heard this a few times and my experience 
                with the prosthetists have never turned out well. I think, if you're good, you don't need to substantiate your abilities with 
                long experience. I'm not saying that experience doesn't count, its not everything.

                  Prosthetic Knee
              </p>
              <p>
                  Currently I use the <a href="https://www.ottobockus.com/products/x3-microprocessor-knee/">Ottobock X3 knee.</a> As a relatively active amputee, I would say that this is one of the best knees 
                  I've had the opportunity of using. The only issue is that this knee is still conisdered by the medical/insurance establishment as experimental.
                  Experiemental means that the medical/insurance establishment is not easily approved and has to be review before approval for insurance payment. 
                  Other knees, such as the C-leg 4 or the Rheo are more easily obtainable once it has been established that you meet their requirements. These knees 
                  are CPU knees, they are electronically controlled and cost more than mechaical knees.

                Traveling with Prosthetics
              </p>
              <p>
                 Traveling in the US with a prosthetic knees can be very interesting depending on which agent checks you. Most of the time, if you 
                 wear shorts, they will do the minimal padding down and explosive residue test. There are some times when they will ask you to step inside a 
                 private room and make you show them more of your prosthesis. It aways takes longer then you want even when you have the TSA pre-check. This is what you 
                 have to look forward to each time you fly in the US. As for as Europe and Asia, they are less intrusive and just do a quick pat down and let you go. 
                 At least that was my experience a few years ago.

                Crutches
              </p>
              <p>
                Yes, I have a pair in my home and a pair at my brother's place. I use them at night or when I need to be out of my prosthesis.
                I had one that was foldable, but got rid of it because it was still too cumbersome to travel with. There are crutches that will fold
                down but are very expensive. My thinking is that if I need a pair of crutches while away from home, I can purchase a pair as they are 
                readily available. I
